# Top 20 System Design Concepts

System Design is crucial for building scalable, reliable, and maintainable applications. Below is a concise guide to 20 fundamental system design concepts, particularly relevant for backend and systems-level C++ developers.

---

## 1. Load Balancing

- **What**: Distributes traffic across multiple servers for reliability and scalability.
- **C++ context**: Used in high-performance servers (e.g., custom load balancers in networking libraries).

---

## 2. Caching

- **What**: Stores frequent data in memory for faster access.
- **C++ context**: Implement in-memory caches using STL containers, custom LRU cache designs, or external systems like Redis.

---

## 3. Database Sharding

- **What**: Splits databases into shards to handle large-scale data growth.
- **C++ context**: Important for designing services that must handle distributed queries efficiently.

---

## 4. Replication

- **What**: Copies data across replicas for availability and fault tolerance.
- **C++ context**: Relevant for systems like distributed storage engines or distributed file systems.

---

## 5. CAP Theorem

- **What**: Trade-off between Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance.
- **C++ context**: Critical in designing distributed systems, especially when using custom consensus protocols.

---

## 6. Consistent Hashing

- **What**: Distributes traffic evenly across servers and minimizes data movement during scaling.
- **C++ context**: Widely implemented in distributed caches, distributed hash tables (DHTs), etc.

---

## 7. Message Queues

- **What**: Decouples services using asynchronous event-driven architecture.
- **C++ context**: Libraries like ZeroMQ, RabbitMQ clients, Kafka clients are often integrated for event streaming.

---

## 8. Rate Limiting

- **What**: Controls request frequency to prevent system overload.
- **C++ context**: Implement using token-bucket algorithms or external rate limiters like Envoy.

---

## 9. API Gateway

- **What**: Centralized entry point for routing API requests.
- **C++ context**: Less common to implement directly in C++, but relevant in architecture design for microservices.

---

## 10. Microservices

- **What**: Breaks systems into independent, loosely coupled services.
- **C++ context**: Especially relevant in high-performance or embedded systems where services handle specialized tasks.

---

## 11. Service Discovery

- **What**: Locates services dynamically in distributed systems.
- **C++ context**: Integrate with systems like Consul, etcd, or custom implementations for dynamic environments.

---

## 12. CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)

- **What**: Delivers content from edge servers for speed and reduced latency.
- **C++ context**: Important when building systems that serve static or streaming content globally.

---

## 13. DB Indexing

- **What**: Speeds up queries by indexing important fields.
- **C++ context**: Critical in custom database engines or when using databases via C++ drivers.

---

## 14. Partitioning

- **What**: Divides data across nodes for scalability and performance.
- **C++ context**: Often used alongside sharding in large-scale systems.

---

## 15. Eventual Consistency

- **What**: Guarantees consistency over time in distributed databases.
- **C++ context**: Key to understanding the behavior of distributed databases or storage engines.

---

## 16. WebSockets

- **What**: Ensures bidirectional communication for live updates.
- **C++ context**: Use libraries like Boost.Beast or custom socket implementations for low-latency communication.

---

## 17. Scalability

- **What**: Increases capacity by upgrading or adding machines.
- **C++ context**: Important for designing systems capable of horizontal scaling without significant code changes.

---

## 18. Fault Tolerance

- **What**: Ensures system availability during hardware/software failures.
- **C++ context**: Exception handling, failover mechanisms, watchdog timers in critical systems.

---

## 19. Monitoring

- **What**: Tracks metrics and logs to understand system health.
- **C++ context**: Integrate with Prometheus, custom metrics collectors, or logging systems like spdlog.

---

## 20. AuthN & AuthZ

- **What**: Controls user access and verifies identity securely.
- **C++ context**: Implement authentication tokens, integrate with OAuth providers, or custom security protocols.
