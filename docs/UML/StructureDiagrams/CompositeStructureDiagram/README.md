## Composite Structure Diagram

Sometimes the primary UML diagrams, such as class and sequence diagrams, aren't a perfect match for
capturing certain details about your system. Composite structures help fill some of those gaps. Composite
structures show how objects create a big picture. They model how objects work together inside a class, or how
objects achieve a goal. Composite structures are fairly advanced, but they're good to have in your bag of tricks
because they are perfectly suited for specific modeling situations, such as showing:



One of the most significant new features in UML 2 is the ability to hierarchically decompose a class
into an internal structure. This allows you to take a complex object and break it down into parts.



Internal structures
Show the parts contained by a class and the relationships between the parts; this allows you to show
context-sensitive relationships, or relationships that hold in the context of a containing class
Ports
Show how a class is used on your system with ports
Collaborations
Show design patterns in your software and, more generally, objects cooperating to achieve a goal
